<p>Campaign rules for Kings of War for use with the the Mighty Empires tiles by GW, or any other hex based map.</p>
<p>All you need to play these rules is the already generated PDF file.</p>
<p>If instead you want to edit the component parts and combine into one document yourself, and convert it into a PDF, you'll need some additional tools.</p>
<p>The component files themselves are written in markdown syntax, and can be eited with any plain text editor.</p>
<p>publish.sh script requires linux with pandoc and wkhtmltopdf installed.<br />
This script will take the chapter files, combine them into a single md files, then a html file, and convert into PDF.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In Mighty Kingdoms each army token represents up to 500 points of a Kings of War army, which are used to explore a hex map to build a player's kingdom.</p>
<p>When other kingdoms are encountered, the army tokens will also be used to fight Kings of War tabletop battles. Bigger battles are fought by bringing multiple army tokens to the same hex.</p>
<p>Players will want their kingdoms to be a mix of villages, cities and fortresses to allow them to build more settlements, recruit more armies, and feed those armies. Each full game turn represents one year, and cycles through summer and winter seasons.</p>
<p>An optional Simple battles system can be used instead of Kings of War battles, to have just a campaign based game without tabletop miniatures battles.</p>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>Players each secretly choose a main race (army type) for their Kingdom. Once all players have chosen, they reveal it to all other players simultaneously. This is public knowledge for the rest of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Players are assigned a random player order. This will change at the end of each summer month in the Reform phase.</p></li>
<li><p>In player order each player takes turns choosing a starting tile (denoted with a white circle) by placing a city on it. This is the player's Capital City.</p></li>
<li><p>In player order each player places all of 1 additional city, 1 fortress, and 2 villages on any of the 6 tiles surrounding the capital, with flags for their empire indicating their control of them. They also place control markers on the other 2 tiles not occupied by settlements to show they are also part of their kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Each player gets 1 army token to start. In player order, each player places it in any tile they control that contains a settlement.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide whether you are going to resolve battles between armies using Kings of War tabletop battles, or Simple battles where you just need a few dice and no miniatures.        i) If using Kings of War battles, each player writes up a 500 pt army list to represent the starting army from the list for their main race as chosen in A) above. The list must be legal as per the standard Kings of War rules, and may not include any allies. Once written, the list for that army is static and may not change except if units are destroyed such as from a loss of Unit Strength in the <em>Reform</em> phase, below. Mark the army token with a unique symbol or number, and mark the list with the same symbol or number so you can keep track of it. Digital only lists may be difficult to use to track the status of the units of an army, so printed lists are encouraged. Lists can be kept secret until a battle occurs with that army, at which point all players (not just those involved) may look at all of the lists involved in the battle. Tales of the battle will spread far and wide in the aftermath of the carnage!        ii) If using Simple battles, just start writing a roster of your armies with the number of the army token and the points value of that army. Each army starts at 500 points, but can take points reductions during the resolution of Simple battles as described later on.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-year">2. The Year</h2>
<p>Play proceeds through the summer season and winter season. The summer season is further broken down into months, during each of which players move armies, explore tiles and engage in battles. During the winter season players build settlements and new armies.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summer-season">3. Summer season</h2>
<p>Summer has six turns, known as months.</p>
<p>Each month is split into 4 phases:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Orders<br />
</li>
<li>Resolution<br />
</li>
<li>Battle<br />
</li>
<li>Reform</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-orders">A) Orders</h3>
<p>In player order, each player chooses one army and gives it an order. This is one order cycle. Repeat the order cycle until all armies have been given an order. Once given, an order may not be changed. A player may not pass when it is their turn unless they have no more armies to give orders to.</p>
<p>Players may choose from any of the following orders for each of their armies. <em>Exception:</em> An army on its side may only choose Regroup.</p>
<p><strong>Move</strong><br />
Put the army you are ordering half into an adjacent tile to show which tile it plans to move into. The adjacent tile can be unexplored or controlled, and it does not matter who controls the tile. The army is still considered to be in the start tile until its order is resolved. Armies may not normally be moved off water tile edges (entirely blue edges) or in to marsh tiles, but may move along the coast.</p>
<p><strong>Defend</strong><br />
The army wishes to set up a defensive position and does not intend to move. The players will gain some advantages if a battle is fought here. See <em>C) Battles</em> below.</p>
<p><strong>Raze</strong><br />
Only choosable if the army is on a settlement. The army intends to burn down the settlement. Turn the settlement upside down to mark this order.</p>
<p><strong>Regroup</strong><br />
Only choosable by an army laying on its side. Stand the army upright.</p>
<h3 id="b-resolution">B) Resolution</h3>
<p>Resolve orders in player order, with each player choosing one army, resolving its order, and then the next player chooses 1 army, and so on until all armies have been resolved.</p>

<h3 id="c-battle">C) Battle</h3>
<p>After resolution, in player order each player chooses a tile in which they have at least one upright army and an enemy has armies. They then choose an enemy in that tile and have a battle. You must choose an opponent with upright armies if possible. When a battle occurs, all armies in the tile from one kingdom fight all the armies in the tile from the other kingdom in a game of Kings of War. The exception is armies on their side do not participate. They are not brought to the table for Kings of War, but they are affected by the results. If all enemies only have armies on their side, remove one of those armies instead of playing a game of Kings of War; the battle is a slaughter of disordered troops instead. Continue choosing battles in player order until there are no more tiles with armies from more than one kingdom on them. This may mean you choose your armies more than once.</p>
<h4 id="simple-battles">Simple battles</h4>
<p>Instead of playing a game of Kings of War to resolve a battle, you may use the following system instead.</p>
<p>As per normal battles above, armies on their sides never get allocated a Defence value or contribute dice as per below.</p>
<p>After choosing an enemy with at least one upright army, each army involved from both players gets a Defence value equal to its points value divided by 100 (eg: as 500 point army is Defence 5).</p>
<p>Any army that took a <em>Defend</em> action gains +1 Defence.</p>
<p>Next, each player in the battle simultaneously rolls 1 die for each army they have.</p>
<p>Starting with the attacker, each player takes turns allocating and resolving 1 die they rolled to one opposing army of their choice. To resolve, if the number on the die is equal to or higher than the Defence of the army it has been allocated to, that army is 'hit' and is reduced by 100 points. An army is destroyed if it is reduced to 0 points and is removed from the board. The die that army generated is still retained if it has not been used, and can be allocated to an enemy army as normal.</p>
<p>After resolving all dice, if there is only armies from one kingdom left, that player wins the battle. If both kingdoms still have armies, compare the points value reductions caused by each kingdom. The kingdom that caused more points to be reduced is the winner, with the other the loser. If the points reductions are equal, the result is a draw. Note that the number of armies or their points values remaining are irrelevant to this result, it is only the reductions caused. This means that although it is unlikely, a lucky smaller army can fight off a larger force if the dice are on their side!</p>
<p>Proceed to <em>Results</em>, below. If <em>Simple battles</em> are being used, ignore all <em>Unit Strength</em> rules.</p>
<h4 id="board-size">Board Size</h4>
<p>Choose a board size based on the largest combined army on one side (not the combination of both sides).</p>

<h4 id="defended-tiles">Defended tiles</h4>
<p>A player that took <em>Defend</em> as their action gains a terrain advantage. Their troops have dug some earthworks, or otherwise chosen an advantageous position from which to defend the tile. Follow the usual setup order of choose scenario, allocate scenery, and roll to choose table sides. However, before the player that chose sides deploys their first unit, the defending player may adjust the table depending on what kind of tile they are defending.</p>

</table>
<p><em>Obstacles</em>: Should be around 6&quot; long each. Or if multiples chosen, can combine for longer pieces. <em>Blocking or difficult</em>: Should be around 6&quot;x6&quot; in area. Or if multiples chosen, can combine areas into larger pieces. <em>Blocking</em> may not be placed within 3&quot; of the centre circle or objective markers. <em>Difficult ground</em> may be either completely flat or height 0, as appropriate to the scenery available and the player's choice.</p>
<h4 id="unit-strength">Unit strength</h4>
<p>During a battle, the first time a unit damages and routs an enemy (shooting or melee) it gains +1 Unit Strength from the next battle onwards, and any unit that is routed has their Unit Strength reduced by 1. Mark these in pencil on the army list. A unit may gain or lose multiple Unit Strength over the course of the month if they are involved in multiple battles. If multiple units caused damage in the same phase to an enemy that is routed that phase, choose only 1 unit to receive the Unit Strength.</p>
<p>These modifiers are permanent and carry over from year to year.</p>
<p>In a Kings of War battle, treat any unit with a negative Unit Strength as Unit Strength 0, and any unit with Unit Strength 4 or greater as 3. However, ensure you track their modified Unit Strength accurately outside of battles, as it will effect whether they are destroyed in the <em>Reform</em> phase, below.</p>

</table>
<p>As you can see from the table, losing or drawing with no adjacent controlled tile can be very dangerous. Keep this in mind before charging deep into enemy territory!</p>
<h3 id="d-reform">D) Reform</h3>
<h4 id="terrain-features">Terrain features</h4>
<p>Armies that have moved may be slowed down by terrain, or forced to find safe passes, trails or fords. To represent this any army that crossed a tile edge containing a mountain or forest (either on their start or finish tile), or into a tile containing a river, is placed on its side. This does not effect armies moving out of a river tile (unless the new tile also contains a river). Any battles between a moving army and an army already in the tile are assumed to have occurred at the borders without the baggage trains involved, which is why Battles are resolved before this effect is applied.</p>
<p>Turn any upside down settlements from a failed Raze back the right way up. Any tiles with only one kingdom's army on them become owned by that kingdom.</p>
<p><em>Reduced strength:</em> Any unit that has a total -2 or worse Unit Strength in the Reform phase is destroyed. For example, if a Regiment (Unit Strength 2) has been routed 4 times without routing any enemies, its total Unit Strength will be 2 - 4 = -2, so it will be destroyed.</p>
<p>List building army composition rules only apply during the initial creation of an army. If reduced Unit Strength destroys a unit that would leave the number of other unit choices invalid (such as destorying a regiment meaning you have too many heroes), this is ok.</p>
<p>If a destroyed unit was the last unit in an army, remove the army.</p>
<h4 id="player-order">Player order</h4>
<p>Player order is redetermined at the end of each <em>Reform</em> phase. Player order is now set by number of armies, descending. <em>That is, the player with the greatest number of armies is now the first player.</em> Randomly determine player order if there are ties in any slots.</p>
<p>Players now start a new Summer month with A) Orders. Repeat until 6 Summer months have passed. Once 6 Summer months have passed, proceed instead to Winter season, below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="winter-season">4. Winter season</h2>
<p>Winter has 4 phases</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Recall armies</li>
<li>Gather resources<br />
</li>
<li>Spend resources<br />
</li>
<li>Deploy armies</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-recall-armies">A) Recall armies</h3>
<p>All players pick up all their armies and place them in their capital city tile. If they do not have a capital city, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months.</p>
<h3 id="b-gather-resources">B) Gather resources</h3>
<p>There are two resources - gold (g) and food (f). Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom. For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your capital city produces an additional gold for you if you control it. If an enemy has taken over your capital it gets downgraded to a regular city and only provides the standard 1 gold for them.</p>
<h3 id="c-spend-resources">C) Spend resources</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tithe.</strong> In player order, each player may give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food, or pass. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each Winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged! Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build and recruit.</strong> In player order, each player makes 1 purchase or passes. Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="settlements">Settlements</h4>
<p>You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building or upgrading settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one.</p>

<p><em>You may only have one Capital City per kingdom, so you may only upgrade a city to a Capital City if your previous Capital City has been razed or taken over.</em></p>
<p>If you want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter.</p>
<h4 id="armies">Armies</h4>
<p>At each Fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 gold to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress. If playing Simple battles, add the notation to your army roster of your new 500 point army. If playing Kings of War battles, assign it a 500 point list as per <em>1). Setup F)</em> above, with the following additional restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living Legends (units denoted [1] in their army lists) must be unique across all the armies in a kingdom, not just unique per army.<br />
</li>
<li>Magic items must also be unique across all the armies in a kingdom.<br />
</li>
<li>Allies may only be taken as an entire army, not as part of an army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. This is only checked when creating the army. If you drop below 3 other armies in a later turn there is no effect on the allied army. An allied army is simply a fully legal army from a list that could normally be allied to your main army. You may only have 1 allied army in your kingdom. When fielded in a game of Kings of War alongside your other armies, it is treated as a normal ally as per the Kings of War ally rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only have a maximum of 6 armies in your entire kingdom. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so. Simply remove an existing army token from the board. This might be prudent where one of your armies has been quite heavily damaged, and you want to recruit a fresh full strength force.<br />
<em>For bigger or longer campaigns you might want to increase this number, noting that players will need enough miniatures to potentially field all of their armies at once.</em></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Feed armies.</strong> If you wish to maintain your armies, you must feed them. For each army you have (including newly purchased ones), you must spend 1 food or remove that army. At the end of this step, any unspent gold or food is lost and is not retained for next Winter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="d-deploy-armies">D) Deploy armies</h3>
<p>Each player removes all their armies from the board and places them in front of them in a staging area. Redetermine player order as normal based on the current number of armies each player has.</p>
<p>In player order, each player places an army in any settlement they control. Players may not pass unless they have deployed all their armies. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table.</p>

No army may enter the Wizard's Tower hex, and no kingdom is ever considered to own the Wizard's Tower. Add an additional option in the Winter B) Spend resources step: Wizard's quest.</p>
<h5 id="wizards-quest">Wizard's Quest</h5>
<p>If you control one or more tiles adjacent to a Wizard’s Tower, you may send one Hero on one quest per tower. The same Hero may not go on two or more quests in a Winter, for each tower it must be different Heroes. Heroes from different kingdoms may go on quests for the same Wizard's Tower, however. The wizarda are equitable, if fickle. Choose a Hero unit from any of your armies, and roll on the below table. Add 1 to the roll for every full 100 points the hero costs.</p>

<p>The hero, if they return, will be back in time to rejoin their army for C) Deploy armies.</p>
<h5 id="magical-artefacts">Magical Artefacts</h5>
<p>Magical artefacts are unique across the entire game, not per army. There should only be one deck of magical artefacts card (or one list), and anytime someone gains one, no other player or army may have that same item. During the deploy armies phase, secretly allocate your items to specific units in your armies. You may not change this allocation until next Winter (losing and recapturing an item is an exception to this). Items on units are revealed at the start of a battle along with the rest of the list. Magical Artefacts are bonus items and do not count towards the points value of the unit or army for any purpose.</p>
<p>If a unit with an item is routed in a battle in which their army loses, give the item to the winning player to allocate to an appropriate unit in that winning army. They may not change this allocation until next winter. If there are no appropriate units in that army (eg: Scarletmaw’s Fenulian Amulet and the army has no Lightning Bolt), the item is considered held by the player’s Capital City instead, to be allocated next Winter. If the player does not hold their Capital city, the item is lost on the field, and returned to the available pool of items for Wizard’s Quests. An item held by a Capital City that is taken over by an enemy is given to a unit in an enemy army that was part of the takeover.</p>
