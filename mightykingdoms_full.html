<h1 id="mighty-kingdoms">Mighty Kingdoms</h1>
<p>Campaign rules for Kings of War for use with the the Mighty Empires tiles by GW, or any other hex based map.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In Mighty Kingdoms each army token represents up to 500 points of a Kings of War army, which are used to explore a hex map to build a player's kingdom. When other kingdoms are encountered, the army tokens will also be used to fight Kings of War tabletop battles. Bigger battles are fought by bringing multiple army tokens to the same hex. Players will want their kingdoms to be a mix of villages, cities and fortresses to allow them to build and feed armies. Each full game turn represents one year, and cycles through summer and winter seasons.</p>

<li>Each player places 1 army token in 1 tile they control that contains a settlement.</li>
<li>Each player writes up a 500 pt army list to represent the starting army. The list must be legal as per the standard Kings of War rules, and may not include any allies. Once written, the list for that army is static and may not change except as per the medal and scar rules, below. Mark the army token with a unique symbol or number, and mark the list with the same symbol or number so you can keep track of it. Digital only lists may be difficult to use to track the status of the units of an army, so printed lists are encouraged. Lists can be kept secret until a battle occurs with that army, at which point all players (not just those involved) may look at all of the lists involved in the battle. Tales of the battle will spread far and wide in the aftermath of the carnage!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-year">2. The Year</h2>
<p>Play proceeds through the summer season and winter season. The summer season is further broken down into months, during each of which players move armies, explore tiles and engage in battles. During the winter season players build settlements and new armies.</p>
<h2 id="summer-season">3. Summer season</h2>
<p>Summer has six turns, known as months.</p>
<p>Each month is split into 4 phases:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Orders<br />
</li>
<li>Resolution<br />
</li>
<li>Battle<br />
</li>
<li>Reform</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-orders">A) Orders</h3>
<p>In player order, each player chooses one army and gives it an order. This is one order cycle. Repeat the order cycle until all armies have been given an order. Once given, an order may not be changed. A player may not pass when it is their turn unless they have no more armies to give orders to.</p>
<p>Players may choose from any of the following orders for each of their armies. An army on its side may only choose Regroup. * Move<br />
Put the army you are ordering half into an adjacent tile to show which tile it plans to move into. The adjacent tile can be unexplored or controlled, and it does not matter who controls the tile. The army is still considered to be in the start tile until its order is resolved.<br />
* Defend<br />
The army wishes to set up a defensive position and does not intend to move. The players will gain some terrain advantages if a battle is fought here. See C) Battles below. * Raze<br />
Only choosable if the army is on a settlement. The army intends to burn down the settlement. Turn the settlement upside down to mark this order.<br />
* Regroup Only choosable by an army laying on its side. Stand an army upright that is on its side.</p>
<h3 id="b-resolution">B) Resolution</h3>
<p>Resolve orders in player order, with each player choosing one army, resolving its order, and then the next player chooses 1 army, and so on until all armies have been resolved.</p>

<h3 id="c-battle">C) Battle</h3>
<p>After resolution, in player order each player chooses a tile in which they have at least one upright army and an enemy has armies. They then choose an enemy in that tile and have a battle. You must choose an opponent with upright armies if possible. When a battle occurs, all armies in the tile from one kingdom fight all the armies in the tile from the other kingdom in a game of Kings of War. The exception is armies on their side do not participate. They are not brought to the table for Kings of War, but they are affected by the results. If all enemies only have armies on their side, remove one of those armies instead of playing a game of Kings of War; the battle is a slaughter of disordered troops instead. Continue choosing battles in player order until there are no more tiles with armies from more than one kingdom on them. This may mean you choose your armies more than once.</p>
<h4 id="board-size">Board Size</h4>
<p>Choose a board size based on the largest combined army on one side (not the combination of both sides). |Battle scale|Board size| |:-----------|:---------| |1-2 armies |4x4 | |3 armies |5x4 | |4-5 armies |6x4 | |6 armies |8x4 |</p>
<h4 id="defend">Defend</h4>
<p>A player that chose Defend as their action gains a terrain advantage. Their troops have dug some earthworks, or otherwise chosen an advantageous position from which to defend the tile. Follow the usual setup order of choose scenario, allocate scenery, and roll to choose table sides. However, before the player that chose sides deploys their first unit, the defending player may add, remove, or move 1 piece of terrain on the table to represent their defensive choices.</p>
<p>During a battle, any unit that damages and routs an enemy (shooting or melee) is given a medal, and any unit that is routed is given a scar. Mark these in pencil on the army list. A unit may only gain one of each per battle, but may earn more than one of each over the course of the month if they are involved in multiple battles. If multiple units caused damage that turn to an enemy that is routed, choose only 1 unit to receive the medal.</p>

<p>As you can see from the table, losing or drawing with no adjacent controlled tile can be very dangerous. Keep this in mind before charging deep into enemy territory.</p>

<p>Turn any upside down settlements from a failed Raze back the right way up. Any tiles with only one kingdom's army on them become owned by that kingdom.</p>
<p>Every scar on a unit is cancelled out by a medal on that unit.</p>
<p>Excess Medals can be used to undo the effects of Scars from previous months, and vice versa with Scars and Medals.</p>

<p>List building army composition rules only apply during the initial creation of an army. If a scar roll destroys a unit that would leave the number of other unit choices invalid (such as destorying a regiment meaning you have too many heroes), this is ok.</p>
<p>After rolling remove all scars from the unit.</p>
<p>If a destroyed unit was the last unit in an army, remove the army.</p>
<h4 id="player-order">Player order</h4>
<p><strong>Player order is redetermined at the end of each <em>Reform</em> phase. Player order is now set by number of armies, descending. <em>That is, the player with the greatest number of armies is now the first player.</em> Randomly determine player order if there are ties in any slots.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="winter-season">4. Winter season</h2>
<p>Winter has 4 phases</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Recall armies</li>
<li>Gather resources<br />
</li>
<li>Spend resources<br />
</li>
<li>Deploy armies</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-recall-armies">A) Recall armies</h3>
<p>All players pick up all their armies and place them in their capital city tile. If they do not have a capital city, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months.</p>
<h3 id="b-gather-resources">B) Gather resources</h3>
<p>There are two resources - food and gold. Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom. For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your capital city produces an additional gold for you if you control it (but not for you or the enemy if an enemy has taken it over).</p>
<h3 id="c-spend-resources">C) Spend resources</h3>
<p>In player order, each player may make one purchase. A purchase may be a settlement, an army, or a tithe. Repeat the purchase cycle until no more players wish to spend resources. Settlements You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one. An greyed out entry means that type of settlement may not be built on that type of tile.</p>
<p>If to want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter.</p>
<h4 id="armies">Armies</h4>
<p>At each fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 food to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress and assign it a list as per 1). Setup F) above, with the following additional restrictions: Living Legends (units denoted [1] in their army lists) must be unique across all the armies in a kingdom, not just unique per army. Magic items must also be unique across all the armies in a kingdom. Allies may only be taken as an entire army, not as part of an army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. This is only checked when creating the army. If you drop below 3 other armies in a later turn there is no effect on the allied army.</p>
<p>You may only have a maximum of 6 armies. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so. Tithe Give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged!</p>
<h3 id="d-deploy-armies">D) Deploy armies</h3>
<p>Place each of your armies in any settlement you control. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table. Deployment limits Settlement Maximum number of armies Village 1 City 2 Fortress 3 Glossary</p>
<p>Unexplored tile: Tiles that no players' armies have visited yet. Controlled tile: A tile that has been explored by an army visiting it. Once explored, a tile will always be controlled by someone. Control is only lost to a player by having it be taken by another player. Kingdom: All the tiles owned by a player. These need not be contiguous. Control marker: A small token representing a player's kingdom, used to mark explored tiles. Settlement: A city, village, fortress. A tile may contain a maximum of 1 settlement. Summer month: A turn in which a player moves their armies to explore and engage in battles. Enemy: Any army, settlement or tile controlled by another player. Capital city: City marker on your starting tile. It only counts as your capital city if it was your starting tile, and if razed and rebuilt will again count as your capital city. If another player controls it it will count as a regular city for them.<br />
