<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In Mighty Kingdoms each army token represents up to 500 points of a Kings of War army, which are used to explore a hex map to build a player's kingdom.</p>
<p>When other kingdoms are encountered, the Kings of War armies represented by the army tokens will be used to fight Kings of War tabletop battles. Bigger battles are fought by bringing multiple army tokens to the same hex.</p>
<p>Players will want their kingdoms to be a mix of villages, cities and fortresses to allow them to build more settlements, recruit more armies, and feed those armies. Each full game turn represents one year, and cycles through summer and winter seasons.</p>
<p>Winning the game is based on how mighty your kingdom is. Might is measured by number of battles won, and number and size of settlements you control at the end.</p>
<p>A campaign lasts for 6 game years (36 turns).</p>

<h2 id="setup">1. Setup</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You wil need to provide around 20 small tokens of your kingdom's livery (colour/logo), approx 1cm square (any shape), to place in the hex tiles you control to show your ownership. These are known as 'control markers'.</p>
<p>Players will also need 3000 points worth of miniatures for Kings of War battles. The bulk must be from your chosen race, however exactly 500 points of that may be allies, the specifics of how to include them is explained in the <em>Winter</em> section below. 3000 points is the theoretical maximum, and will only be required when a player brings their entire kindgom's forces against another's.</p>
<h3 id="initial-kingdom">Initial kingdom</h3>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Players each secretly choose a main race (army type) for their Kingdom. Once all players have chosen, they reveal it to all other players simultaneously. This is public knowledge for the rest of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Players are assigned a random player order. This will change at the end of each summer month in the Reform phase.</p></li>
<li><p>In player order each player takes turns choosing a starting tile (denoted with a white circle) by placing a city on it. This is the player's Capital City.</p></li>
<li><p>In player order each player places all of 1 additional city, 1 fortress, and 2 villages on any of the 6 tiles surrounding the capital, with flags for their empire indicating their control of them. They also place control markers on the other 2 tiles not occupied by settlements to show they are also part of their kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Each player gets 1 army token to start. In player order, each player places it in any tile they control that contains a settlement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The army token represents a 500 pt army list for their main race as chosen in A) above. The list must be legal as per the standard Kings of War rules, and may not include any allies. Each army token always represents 500 points. To have bigger battles, players bring more army tokens to the same hex to commit them all to a battle. To speed up the transition from map movement to tabletop battle, players are encouraged to pre-write up a list for each of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000. You may write up a few options for each value if you want, and change them whenever you want, as the lists will not be fixed until the actual battle. You can just wait until the battle is about to occur to write your list as the composition of the army list can vary from battle to battle and will not need to be tracked explicitly, but this may slow down the overall game.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-year">2. The Year</h2>
<p>Play proceeds through the <em>Summer</em> season and <em>Winter</em> season. The <em>Summer</em> season is further broken down into months, during each of which players move armies, explore tiles and engage in battles. During the <em>Winter</em> season players build settlements and new armies.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summer-season">3. Summer season</h2>
<p>Summer has six turns, known as months.</p>
<p>Each month is split into 4 phases:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Orders<br />
</li>
<li>Resolution<br />
</li>
<li>Battle<br />
</li>
<li>Reform</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-orders">A) Orders</h3>
<p><em>First player brakes</em>: To minimise the compounding benefit of having more armies, if the first player has more armies than the second player, the first player chooses an order for <em>all</em> of their armies before any other players. Then proceed to <em>Order cycle</em>, below.</p>
<p><em>Order cycle</em>: In player order, each player chooses one army and gives it an order. Repeat the order cycle until all armies have been given an order. Once given, an order may not be changed. A player may not pass when it is their turn unless they have no more armies to give orders to. The first player is not included in the <em>Order cycle</em> if they had more armies as per <em>First player breaks</em>, above.</p>
<p>Ships are given orders in the same way as armies. If an army shares a tile with a ship, it may set sail with them. The army and ship are paired up for the order, and the pair is treated as part of the ship for movement. Each ship can pair with only one army. By doing this a player may move armies across oceans. Ship/army pairs are only given one order for the pair, and the orders are resolved as one order. A pair can unpair at the start of any order phase if the player wishes, unless on the open ocean!</p>
<p>Players may choose from any of the following orders for each of their armies. <em>Exception:</em> An army on its side may only choose Regroup.</p>
<p><strong>Move</strong><br />
Put the army or ship you are ordering half into an adjacent tile to show which tile it plans to move into. The adjacent tile can be unexplored or controlled, and it does not matter who controls the tile. The army or ship is still considered to be in the start tile until its order is resolved.</p>
<p>Armies may not normally be moved off water tile edges (entirely blue edges) or in to marsh tiles, but may move along the coast.</p>
<p>Ships may only be moved along coastal, open ocean, and river tiles. They still may not enter marsh tiles.</p>
<p><strong>Defend</strong><br />
The army wishes to set up a defensive position and does not intend to move. The players will gain some advantages if a battle is fought here. See <em>C) Battles</em> below.</p>
<p>Ships or ship/army pairs may not choose the <em>Defend</em> order.</p>
<p><strong>Raze</strong><br />
Only choosable if the army or ship is on a settlement. They intend to burn down the settlement. Turn the settlement upside down to mark this order.</p>
<p><strong>Regroup</strong><br />
Only choosable for an army or ship laying on its side. The leaders call their units together and give some inspiring speeches. Flip the token over from army number face down to army number face up to show it has been given an order. It will stand up in the <em>Resolution</em> phase below.</p>
<h3 id="b-resolution">B) Resolution</h3>
<p>Resolve orders in player order, with each player choosing one army or ship, resolving its order, and then the next player chooses one army or ship, and so on until all armies have been resolved.</p>
<p>Open water tiles (complete blue) never contain settlements and are never controlled. Ignore any such control or settlement effects for moving into those tiles.</p>

<h3 id="c-battle">C) Battle</h3>
<p>After order resolution, in player order each player chooses a tile in which they have at least one upright army or ship and an enemy has armies or ships. They then choose an enemy in that tile and have a battle. You must choose an opponent with upright armies or ships if possible. From among those players with upright armies or ships, you must then choose the player that controls the tile if possible. This is to try and minimise the instances of two players having a battle on a tile controlled by a third player, and having their battle result determine the tile owner. Armies and ships on their sides will not participate, but will be affected by the results of the battles.</p>
<p>Note that this phase is about choosing battle, and resolving battles with the appropriate forces in the tile; not choosing individual army or ship tokens.</p>
<p>Either player may choose to concede the field instead of having a pitched battle. The conceder is considered to have taken a <em>loss</em> result, with the other player taking a <em>win</em> (see <em>Results</em>, below). A player who's opponent has more army tokens than them in the hex <strong>must</strong> concede the field. A win on concession (forced or chosen) does <strong>not</strong> count for gaining <em>might</em> in the end of campaign scoring.</p>
<p><strong>Last Stand</strong>: An exception to forced conceding is the Last Stand. If a player has no friendly adjacent tiles, they may choose to fight a Pitched Battle instead of automatically conceding. As this will be a very one sided battle, it will be rare that people would choose this, but it might be the stuff legends are made of! The winner will get 1 <em>might</em> as normal for a pitched battle.</p>
<p>The type of battle depends on the type of tokens on the tile.</p>
<h4 id="naval-battles">Naval battles</h4>
<p>If there are ships from opposing kingdoms on the tile, you may choose to have a naval battle. Each player rolls 1 die for each ship they control. Each ship with a paired army adds +1 to the roll. All dice get -1 if the battle is on a river tile. For every 4+ you roll, remove one ship or ship/army pair from your opponent. Yes, the brutality of naval combat could have you losing whole armies at a time if they are onboard ships that sink! The player losing the ship decides which ones are lost if they have several to choose from. Repeat this roll-off until one player declares themselves the loser after resolving all rolled dice (the other player wins), or there are no ships left from the battling players. There are no draws at sea.</p>
<h4 id="pitched-battles">Pitched battles</h4>
<p>If there are armies from opposing kingdoms on the tile, you will have a pitched battle. When a pitched battle occurs, all armies in the tile from one kingdom fight all the armies in the tile from the other kingdom in a game of Kings of War.</p>
<h4 id="slaughter">Slaughter</h4>
<p>If all enemies only have armies or ships tokens laying on their side, remove one of those armies or ships instead of playing a game of Kings of War; the battle is a slaughter of disordered troops instead.</p>
<h4 id="landwater-battles">Land/water battles</h4>
<p>If one player has ships and the other has armies, they try and drive each other out. Each player rolls one dice for each army or ship they have (ship/army pairs count as 2 dice in this instance), and adds up the total. The higher player defeats the lower player. Equal values equals a draw. No ships or armies are damaged in this engagement unless forced to retreat to unfrendly tiles as per below.</p>
<h4 id="simple-battles">Simple battles</h4>
<p>Instead of playing a game of Kings of War to resolve a pitched battle, you may use the following system instead. This may be required if a player is unable to schedule a Kings of War game before play is to progress.</p>
<p>As per normal land battles above, armies on their sides never get allocated a Defence value or contribute dice as per below.</p>
<p>After choosing an enemy with at least one upright army, each upright army involved from both players gets a Defence value of 4.</p>
<p>Defence is modified as followed:</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">In Fortress they control</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">+1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Next, each player in the battle simultaneously rolls 1 die for each army they have.</p>
<p>Starting with the attacker, each player takes turns allocating and resolving 1 die they rolled to one opposing army of their choice. To resolve, if the number on the die is equal to or higher than the Defence of the army it has been allocated to, that army is 'hit'.</p>
<p>Whoever scores the most hits gets a <em>win</em> result, with the other player a <em>loss</em>. If the number of hits is equal, a <em>draw</em> occurs.</p>
<p>Proceed to <em>Results</em>, below.</p>

<p>A player that took <em>Defend</em> as their action gains a terrain advantage in a pitched battle. Their troops have dug some earthworks, or otherwise chosen an advantageous position from which to defend the tile. Follow the usual setup order of choose scenario, allocate scenery, and roll to choose table sides. However, before the player that chose sides deploys their first unit, the defending player may adjust the table depending on what kind of tile they are defending.</p>

</table>
<p>As you can see from the table, losing or drawing with no adjacent controlled tile can be very dangerous. Keep this in mind before charging deep into enemy territory!</p>
<p>Continue choosing battles in player order until there are no more tiles with armies or ships from more than one kingdom on them. This may mean you choose your armies more than once.</p>
<h3 id="d-reform">D) Reform</h3>
<h4 id="terrain-features">Terrain features</h4>
<p>Armies that have moved may be slowed down by terrain, or forced to find safe passes, trails or fords. To represent this any army that crossed a tile edge containing a mountain or forest (either on their start or finish tile), or into a tile containing a river, is placed on its side, army token number down. This does not effect armies moving <em>out of</em> a river tile (unless the new tile also contains a river). Any battles between a moving army and an army already in the tile are assumed to have occurred at the borders without the baggage trains involved, which is why Battles are resolved before this effect is applied.</p>
<p>Ships and ship/army pairs ignore the effects of this for river tiles and may move up and down rivers without penalty.</p>
<p>Turn any upside down settlements from a failed Raze back the right way up. Any tiles with only one kingdom's army on them become owned by that kingdom.</p>
<h4 id="player-order">Player order</h4>
<p>Player order is redetermined at the end of each <em>Reform</em> phase. Player order is now set by number of armies, descending. <strong><em>That is, the player with the greatest number of armies is now the first player.</em></strong> Randomly determine player order if there are ties in any slots.</p>
<p>Players now start a new Summer month with <em>A) Orders</em>. Repeat until 6 Summer months have passed. Once 6 <em>Summer</em> months have passed, proceed instead to <em>Winter</em> season, below.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="winter-season">4. Winter season</h2>
<p>Winter has 4 phases</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Recall armies</li>
<li>Gather resources<br />
</li>
<li>Spend resources<br />
</li>
<li>Deploy armies<br />
</li>
<li>(Optional) Scoring</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-recall">A) Recall</h3>
<p><em>Connected tile:</em> A tile that can trace a contiguous series of controlled tiles to another tile.</p>
<p>All armies that are in a tile that is <em>connected</em> to their Capital City are picked up and placed in their Capital City tile. If they do not have a Capital City, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months.</p>
<p><em>Lines of supply:</em> Every army that is in a tile that is not <em>connected</em> to their Capital City tile is destroyed. Try not to get cut off!</p>
<p>Each ship is picked up and returned to a coastal city or river city tile controlled by the same player as the ship. As each ship actually represents a small fleet of vessels, each city can only dock one ship over the Winter, and no new ships may be built in a city that has a ship in dock.</p>
<p><em>Eliminated players:</em> Any player with no controlled tiles at this stage is eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="b-gather-resources">B) Gather resources</h3>
<p>There are two resources - gold (g) and food (f). Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom. For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your capital city produces an additional gold for you if you control it. If an enemy has taken over your capital it gets downgraded to a regular city and only provides the standard 1 gold for them.</p>
<h3 id="c-spend-resources">C) Spend resources</h3>
<p>This phase contains the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tithe.</li>
<li>Build and recruit.</li>
<li>Feed armies.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i">
<li><p><strong>Tithe.</strong> In player order, each player may give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food, or pass. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each Winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged! Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build and recruit.</strong> In player order, each player makes 1 purchase or passes. Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Settlements</strong> You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building or upgrading settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one.</p>

<p><em>You may only have one Capital City per kingdom, so you may only upgrade a city to a Capital City if your previous Capital City has been razed or taken over. Note that as the upgrade occurs after gaining resources, the newly designated Capital City does not provide an additional gold this turn.</em></p>
<p>If you want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter.</p>
<p><strong>Ships</strong> You may build a ship at the cost of 1 gold. It must be placed in one of your cities on the coast or on a river that does not already have a ship at it. If there are no such vacant cities, you may not build any ships.</p>
<p><strong>Armies</strong> At each Fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 gold to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress. This will serve as a reminder that that fortress has already recruited this phase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allies may only be taken as an entire 500 point army, not as part of another army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. You may only have 1 allied army in your kingdom, and the list to which it belongs is chosen and fixed when purchased. When fielded in a game of Kings of War alongside your other armies, it is treated as a normal ally as per the Kings of War ally rules. If fielded alone, it counts as the main army. Note which army token number is the ally, and its racial list. This information is public.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may only have a maximum of 6 armies in your entire kingdom. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so. Simply remove an existing army token from the board. This will likely only happen where you want to switch an allied army to another race, or to allow deployment to annexed fortresses.</p>
<ol start="3" type="i">
<li><strong>Feed armies.</strong> If you wish to maintain your armies, you must feed them. For each army you have (including newly purchased ones), you must spend 1 food or remove that army. Note that villages need not be connected to the Capital City to feed the armies, it is assumed smugglers can secretly move goods, or the militia are not concerned enough to prevent caravans passing through enemy territories.</li>

<p>At the end of this phase, any unspent gold or food is lost and is not retained for next Winter.</p>
<h3 id="d-deploy-armies">D) Deploy armies</h3>
<p>Each player removes all their armies from the board and places them in front of them in a staging area. <em>Exception</em>: Armies recruited into a Fortress that is not connected to your Capital City remain in that Fortress. Redetermine player order as normal based on the current number of armies each player has.</p>
<p>Ships start summer in the city they were docked in over Winter, so are not part of deployment.</p>
<p><em>First player brake</em>: If the first player has more armies than the second player, then they must deploy all their armies first before the other players place as per below.</p>
<p>In player order, each player places an army from their staging area into any settlement they control that is connected to their Capital City. Players may not pass unless they have no more armies in their staging area. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table. If there is no more room left to deploy an army due to the settlement deployment limits, the army is destroyed.</p>

<p>Once deployment is completed, if 6 years have passed go to <em>E) Scoring</em>, otherwise start a new <em>3) Summer</em> season. Note that deployment needs to occur before scoring to ensure the kingdoms have enough settlements to deploy their armies to.</p>
<h3 id="e-scoring">E) Scoring</h3>
<p>If 6 full years have passed, the campaign is over and its time to score.</p>
<p>Each player will have gained 1 <em>might</em> for each pitched tabletop battle of Kings of War they won during the campaign.</p>
<p>In addition, add <em>might</em> for each of the following that the player controls at the end of the campaign:</p>

<p>The players are ranked by <em>might</em>, and the player with the most <em>might</em> is the winner.</p>
<p>In the case of ties for <em>might</em>, use the following series of tiebreakers in order until the places are broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most armies</li>
<li>Most cities (including Capital City)</li>
<li>Most fortresses</li>
<li>Most villages</li>
<li>Most number of years before eliminated</li>
</ul>
<p>If players are still tied after all of those, they rejoice in their shared placement.<br />
###Glossary</p>
<p>Unexplored tile: Tiles that no players' armies have visited yet.</p>
<p>Controlled tile: A tile that has been explored by an army visiting it. Once explored, a tile will always be controlled by someone. Control is only lost to a player by having it taken by another player.</p>
<p>Kingdom: All the tiles owned by a player. These need not be contiguous.</p>
<p>Control marker: A small token representing a player's kingdom, used to mark explored tiles.</p>
<p>Army token: A toekn that represents 500 points of Kings of War armies controlled by a player, used to explore the map and conquer other players.</p>
<p>Settlement: A city, village, or fortress.</p>
<p>Summer month: A turn in which a player moves their armies to explore and engage in battles.</p>
<p>Enemy: Any army, settlement or tile controlled by another player.</p>
<p>Capital City: Initially the City marker on your starting tile. It only counts as your capital city if it was <em>your</em> starting tile. If another player controls it it will count as a regular city for them. If this happens, you can nominate another of your cities to be your capital in the <em>Winer</em> phase.</p>
