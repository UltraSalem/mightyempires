## Fortification sections

Each castle or fortification is considered to be made up of multiple different sections. Sections are either walls or towers. Walls should generally be about 6" long, depending on your model, and have ramparts at least deep enough to hold a large infantry regiment (40mm). A castle gate is part of a wall or tower section as appropriate to the model. However, the gate can be attacked separately to the section.

Each section has a height. This height is used for the purposes of the section blocking LOS, the effective hill height of defenders firing out off a section, and determining what height units on the ground can attack defenders and be attacked by defenders.

## Occupying defences

Each section can have at most one unit from the following on top of it:  

* Infantry troop  
* Large Infantry regiment  
* Monster or   
* War Machine  

plus one Hero (any kind).  

Monsters can only be on castle sections provided:
- more than 50% of their base fits on the section.
- the castle section is no more than 1 height larger than the monster OR the monster has *Fly* (to be able to scale the walls to take their position).

Units on sections count as being on a hill of the relevant height, and also gain *Big Shield* and *Ensnare* (if they didn't already have them).

The crenellations along the edges of walls and towers count as *obstacles*. This generally means units defending walls and towers will have cover (height permitting), and attackers will be hindered on charges.

## Melee  

To attack in melee an attacker must charge the section as if it were a unit. Attackers choose whether to charge the section itself, a gate in the section, or an enemy on the section. Regardless of which option they take, they are moved and aligned to the section as if it were a unit.

To attack the section itself of the gate, attackers have no special height requirements.

To attack an enemy on a section, the attacker must have height equal to or greater than the height of the section -1. So an attacker would need to be a Monster (height 4) to attack defenders on a height 5 stone tower.

Attackers that charged a section are not moved 1" back at the end of combat if they fail to rout their oponent. They remain in base to base contact.

Units on sections may attack in melee enemies touching that section by declaring a charge or counter charge as normal. However, they are not moved off their section to do so. They may also only attack enemies that have a height equal to or greater than the height of the section -1. So for example defenders on a height 4 stone wall can generally only attack Monsters or Large Cavalry on the ground. 

Shooting attackers choose whether to attack the section itself, a gate in the section, or an enemy on the section. Measure all ranges to any part of the section itself, rather than the unit.

Defenders shooting out of a castle count as being on a hill (with suggested heights as below). Remember suggested height ratings are one height level for every 1" of physical on the table height. Feel free to use different heights to the below to match your actual castle models. Just make sure both you and your opponent know what they are before the game.

Gate - De 7+, Ne -/18, Phalanx
Wooden wall - De 7+, Ne 15/20, Phalanx, Height 3
Stone Wall - De 8+, Ne 15/20, Phalanx, Height 4
Wooden Tower - De 8+, Ne 18/23, Phalanx, Height 4
Stone Tower - De 9+, Ne 18/23, Phalanx, Height 5

To damage a castle section you must roll the required De value. Unlike rolling to attack, where penalties that take the roll to hit higher than 6 reduce your dice by half, there is no reduced dice count for attempting to damage something with a De higher than 6+. Instead, to damage a section you will require having sufficient Crushing Strength or Piecing to roll the required number, as even a natural 6 will not damage anything with De 7+ or higher.

Wavered castle sections never recover from being wavered. Castle sections that are wavered no longer provide the Ensnare provided by the castle section.

Routed sections are destroyed and replaced with a rectangular height 1 obstacle (the rubble) covering approximately the same footprint as the destroyed section. Any unit in or on a routed section takes a single automatic Blast (D6) hit at piercing (3) and must take a nerve test if wounded. This is in addition to any wounds and nerve tests for shooting or melee. Place the unit on the ground facing any direction the owner chooses, with one unit edge along either side of the rubble obstacle, aligned as centred as possible .

If a section of wall with a gate on it is destroyed, so too is the gate. Only place 1 rubble obstacle to replace the whole section.
