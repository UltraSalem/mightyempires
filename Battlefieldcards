##Asymmetrical battles

The whole point of playing a campaign is to have fun. However, playing lopsided battles where one player has a larger army than another can impact on the fun somewhat.

There are tactical considerations of course: avoiding committing to a battle where you have a disadvantage is a fairly obvious strategic move. If you did not avoid the fight, you are likely to lose anyway, so there is little to be gained from even trying.

Having said that; the outnumbered, outclassed underdog standing up to the vicious conquering hordes, and claiming victory, is what legends are made of!

The Mantic Battlefield cards are a good way to even things up a bit, without making the battles perfectly matched. After all, there should still be a reason to bring a bigger force to bear.

To use the Battlefield cards for the campaign you will only need one deck per battle, which will be refered to as the *common deck*, not one deck per player.

####Pre-campaign setup:
Remove the following Condition cards from the deck, they will not be used for random drawing (although may apply in specific situations where noted in the Mighty Kingdoms rules).
10. Thunderclouds
11. Unreplenished casualties

####Game setup
Follow the normal instructions as printed on the cards (summarised below), except apply the modifications noted.
0. Set up scenery
1. Shuffle cards and choose sides. Side chooser goes first for other steps except as noted.
2. Centre objective
3. Field objectives - Middle 6" from centre line objectives
4. Base objectives - Deep in opposing half objectives (12" from centre line)
5. Define field and base
6. Draw one Condition card for the battle
7. **Modification**: Deal 2 Objective cards to each player from the *common deck*. Then the players choose primary and secondary as normal.
8. **Modification**: Each player draws one Strategy card from the *common deck* for each army token brought to the battle by the *opposing* player. Generally this is equivalent to one card per 500 points you are playing *against*, rather than the normal one card per 500 points in *your* force.
9. Deploy
10. Play
11. Reveal secondary Objective at *your* turn 4.
