*Army token:* A token that represents 500 points of Kings of War armies controlled by a player, used to explore the map and conquer other players.

*Capital City:* Initially the city marker on your starting tile. It only counts as your capital city if it was *your* starting tile. If another player controls it it will count as a regular city for them. If this happens, you can nominate another of your cities to be your capital in the *Winer* phase. 

*Connected tile:* A tile that can trace a contiguous series of controlled tiles to another tile.

*Control marker: *A small token representing a player's kingdom, used to mark explored tiles.  

*Controlled tile:* A tile that has been explored by an army visiting it. Once explored, a tile will always be controlled by someone. Control is only lost to a player by having it taken by another player.  

*Enemy: *Any army, settlement or tile controlled by another player.  

*Kingdom:* All the tiles owned by a player. These need not be contiguous.  

*Settlement:* A city, village, or fortress.  

*Summer month:* A turn in which a player moves their armies to explore and engage in battles.  

*Unexplored tile:* Tiles that no players' armies have visited yet.
