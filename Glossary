Unexplored tile: Tiles that no players' armies have visited yet.  

Controlled tile: A tile that has been explored by an army visiting it. Once explored, a tile will always be controlled by someone. Control is only lost to a player by having it taken by another player.  

Kingdom: All the tiles owned by a player. These need not be contiguous.  

Control marker: A small token representing a player's kingdom, used to mark explored tiles.  

Army token: A toekn that represents 500 points of Kings of War armies controlled by a player, used to explore the map and conquer other players.

Settlement: A city, village, or fortress.  

Summer month: A turn in which a player moves their armies to explore and engage in battles.  

Enemy: Any army, settlement or tile controlled by another player.  

Capital City: Initially the City marker on your starting tile. It only counts as your capital city if it was *your* starting tile. If another player controls it it will count as a regular city for them. If this happens, you can nominate another of your cities to be your capital in the *Winer* phase.
