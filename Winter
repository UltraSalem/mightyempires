##4. Winter season

Winter has 4 phases

A) Recall armies
B) Gather resources  
C) Spend resources  
D) Deploy armies  

###A) Recall armies
All players pick up all their armies and place them in their capital city tile. If they do not have a capital city, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months. 

###B) Gather resources
There are two resources - food and gold. Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom.
For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your capital city produces an additional gold for you if you control it (but not for you or the enemy if an enemy has taken it over). 

###C) Spend resources
In player order, each player may make one purchase. A purchase may be a settlement, an army, or a tithe. Repeat the purchase cycle until no more players wish to spend resources.
Settlements
You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one. An greyed out entry means that type of settlement may not be built on that type of tile.

If to want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter.

####Armies
At each fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 food to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress and assign it a list as per 1). Setup F) above, with the following additional restrictions:
Living Legends (units denoted [1] in their army lists) must be unique across all the armies in a kingdom, not just unique per army.
Magic items must also be unique across all the armies in a kingdom.
Allies may only be taken as an entire army, not as part of an army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. This is only checked when creating the army. If you drop below 3 other armies in a later turn there is no effect on the allied army.

You may only have a maximum of 6 armies. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so.
Tithe
Give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged! 
 
###D) Deploy armies 
Place each of your armies in any settlement you control. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table.
