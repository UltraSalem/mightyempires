##4. Winter season

Winter has 4 phases

A) Recall armies
B) Gather resources  
C) Spend resources  
D) Deploy armies  
E) (Optional) Scoring

###A) Recall armies
*Connected tile:* A tile that can trace a contiguous series of controlled tiles to another tile.

All armies that are in a tile that is *connected* to their Capital City are picked up and placed in their Capital City tile. If they do not have a Capital City, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months.

*Lines of supply:* Every army that is in a tile that is not *connected* to their Capital City tile is destroyed.

Each ship is picked up and returned to a coastal city or river city tile controlled by the same player as the ship. As each ship actually represents a small fleet of vessels, each city can only dock one ship over the Winter, and no new ships may be built in a city that has a ship in dock.

*Eliminated players:* Any player with no controlled tiles at this stage is eliminated.

###B) Gather resources
There are two resources - gold (g) and food (f). Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom.
For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your Capital City produces an additional gold for you if you control it. 

###C) Spend resources

This phase contains the following steps:

i. Tithe.
ii. Build and recruit.
iii. Feed armies.

<!---end list--->

i.  **Tithe.** In player order, each player may give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food, or pass. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each Winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged! Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing. 

ii. **Build and recruit.** In player order, each player makes 1 purchase or passes. Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing. 

**Settlements**  
You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building or upgrading settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one. 

|Tile       |Upgrade to      |Cost   |
|:----------|:---------------|:------|
|Empty      |Village         |1g     |
|Village    |City            |1g 1f  |
|Village    |Fortress        |2g     |
|City       |Capital City    |Free  |

*You may only have one Capital City per kingdom, so you may only upgrade a city to a Capital City if your previous Capital City has been razed or taken over. Note that as the upgrade occurs after gaining resources, the newly designated Capital City does not provide an additional gold this turn.* 

If you want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter. 

**Ships**  
You may build a ship at the cost of 1 gold. It must be placed in one of your cities on the coast or on a river that does not already have a ship at it. If there are no such vacant cities, you may not build any ships.

**Armies**  
At each Fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 gold to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress. This will serve as a reminder that that fortress has already recruited this phase. 

* Allies may only be taken as an entire 500 point army, not as part of another army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. You may only have 1 allied army in your kingdom, and the list to which it belongs is chosen and fixed when purchased. When fielded in a game of Kings of War alongside your other armies, it is treated as a normal ally as per the Kings of War ally rules. If fielded alone, it counts as the main army. Note which army token number is the ally, and its racial list. This information is public.

You may only have a maximum of 6 armies in your entire kingdom. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so. Simply remove an existing army token from the board. This will likely only happen where you want to switch an allied army to another race, or to allow deployment to annexed fortresses.

iii. **Feed armies.**  
If you wish to maintain your armies, you must feed them. For each army you have (including newly purchased ones), you must spend 1 food or remove that army. Note that villages need not be *connected* to the Capital City to feed the armies.
  
At the end of this phase, any unspent gold or food is lost and is not retained for next Winter.
  
###D) Deploy armies 

Each player removes all their armies from the board and places them in front of them in a staging area. 

*Exception*: Armies recruited into a Fortress that is not *connected* to your Capital City remain in that Fortress. Redetermine player order as normal based on the current number of armies each player has.

Ships start summer in the city they were docked in over Winter, so are not part of deployment.

*First player brakes*: If the first player has more armies than the second player, then they must deploy all their armies first before the other players place as per below. 

In player order, each player places an army from their staging area into any settlement they control that is *connected* to their Capital City. Players may not pass unless they have no more armies in their staging area. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table. If there is no more room left to deploy an army due to the settlement deployment limits, the army is destroyed.

####Deployment limits
|Settlement|Maximum number of armies|
|:-----------|:---------------------:|
|Village|1|
|City|2|
|Capital City|3|
|Fortress|3|

Once deployment is completed, if 6 years have passed go to *E) Scoring*, otherwise start a new *3) Summer* season. Note that deployment needs to occur before scoring to ensure the kingdoms have enough settlements to deploy their armies to.

###E) Scoring

Each player will have gained 1 *might* for each pitched tabletop battle of Kings of War they won during the campaign.

In addition, add *might* for each of the following that the player controls at the end of the campaign:

Controlled Object|Might|
|:-----------|:---------------------:|
|Village|1|
|City|2|
|Fortress|2|
|Capital City|3|
|Army|5|

The players are ranked by *might*, and the player with the most *might* is the winner.

In the case of ties for *might*, use the following series of tiebreakers in order until the places are broken.

* Most armies
* Most cities (including Capital City)
* Most fortresses
* Most villages
* Most number of years before eliminated

If players are still tied after all of those, they rejoice in their shared placement.
