##4. Winter season

Winter has 4 phases

A) Recall armies
B) Gather resources  
C) Spend resources  
D) Deploy armies  

###A) Recall armies
All players pick up all their armies and place them in their capital city tile. If they do not have a capital city, they place them in one other city tile of their choice. If there are no other cities either, choose a village tile. If there are no villages either, the armies are destroyed. A kingdom that is all Fortresses cannot support the armies over the winter months. 

###B) Gather resources
There are two resources - gold (g) and food (f). Each player gathers resources simultaneously based on the settlements in their kingdom.
For every village you control, gain 1 food. For every city you control, gain 1 gold. Your capital city produces an additional gold for you if you control it. If an enemy has taken over your capital it gets downgraded to a regular city and only provides the standard 1 gold for them. 

###C) Spend resources
  1. **Tithe.** In player order, each player may give 1 other player up to 1 gold and up to 1 food, or pass. These gifts may not be refused, but may be given away by the receiver in a later tithe action of their own. A player may only tithe to each enemy once each Winter. A tithe may or may not be attached to deals, promises or threats, none of which are enforcable. Backstabbing is encouraged! Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.  
  
  2. **Build and recruit.** In player order, each player makes 1 purchase or passes. Continue cycling through all players until everyone has passed in a row. Players may jump back in on their turn if they passed, as long as this sub-phase has not ended by everyone passing.  
  
####Settlements
You may build settlements in tiles you control. Each tile may only contain one settlement. Consult the following list for the cost of building or upgrading settlements in various target tiles you control. If you build a settlement in a tile that already contains a settlement, the old settlement is replaced with the new one.  

|Tile       |Upgrade to      |Cost   |
|:----------|:---------------|:------|
|Empty      |Village         |1g     |
|Village    |City            |1g 1f  |
|Village    |Fortress        |2g     |
|City       |Capital City    |1g 1f  |
  
*You may only have one Capital City per kingdom, so you may only upgrade a city to a Capital City if your previous Capital City has been razed or taken over.*  

If you want to make radical changes to your kingdom's demographics, you may want to Raze the settlements during the summer. You cannot voluntarily destroy settlements during the winter.  

####Armies
At each Fortress you may recruit 1 army each winter. You may use a fortress you built this winter to recruit an army. An army costs 1 gold to recruit. Place an army token in the fortress. If playing Simple battles, add the notation to your army roster of your new 500 point army. If playing Kings of War battles, assign it a 500 point list as per *1). Setup F)* above, with the following additional restrictions:  

* Living Legends (units denoted [1] in their army lists) must be unique across all the armies in a kingdom, not just unique per army.  
* Magic items must also be unique across all the armies in a kingdom.  
* Allies may only be taken as an entire army, not as part of an army. You may only take an allied army if you have 3 or more other non-allied armies already. This is only checked when creating the army. If you drop below 3 other armies in a later turn there is no effect on the allied army. An allied army is simply a fully legal army from a list that could normally be allied to your main army. You may only have 1 allied army in your kingdom. When fielded in a game of Kings of War alongside your other armies, it is treated as a normal ally as per the Kings of War ally rules. 

You may only have a maximum of 6 armies in your entire kingdom. If you wish to build a new army when you already have 6, you may disband an existing army to do so. Simply remove an existing army token from the board. This might be prudent where one of your armies has been quite heavily damaged, and you want to recruit a fresh full strength force.  
*For bigger or longer campaigns you might want to increase this number, noting that players will need enough miniatures to potentially field all of their armies at once.*   

  3. **Feed armies.** If you wish to maintain your armies, you must feed them. For each army you have (including newly purchased ones), you must spend 1 food or remove that army. At the end of this step, any unspent gold or food is lost and is not retained for next Winter.  
  
###D) Deploy armies 
Each player removes all their armies from the board and places them in front of them in a staging area. Redetermine player order as normal based on the current number of armies each player has.

In player order, each player places an army in any settlement they control. Players may not pass unless they have deployed all their armies. Settlements may only have a limited number of armies deployed to each of them as seen in the following table.

####Deployment limits
|Settlement|Maximum number of armies|
|:-----------|:---------------------:|
|Village|1|
|City|2|
|Capital City|3|
|Fortress|3|

Once deployment is completed, start a new 3) Summer season.
