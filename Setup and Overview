Setup

Initial kingdom
1) Players are assigned a random play order. This will change at the end of each month in the Reform phase.
2) In play order each player takes turns choosing a starting tile (denoted with a white circle) by placing a city on it.
3) In play order each player places all of 1 additional city, 1 fortress, and 2 villages on any of the 6 tiles surrounding the capital. They also place control markers on the other 2 tiles not occupied by settlements.
4) Each player places 1 army in 1 tile they control that contains a settlement.
5) Army list. Each player writes up a 500 pt list to represent the army. The list may not contain any living legends, magic items, war machines, or monsters (including hero monsters). Once written, the list for that army is static and may not change except as per the medal and scar rules, below. Mark the army token with a unique symbol or number, and mark the list with the same symbol or number so you can keep track of it.

The Year

Play proceeds through the summer season and winter season. The summer season is further broken down into months, during each of which players move armies, explore tiles and engage in battles. During the winter season players build settlements and new armies.
