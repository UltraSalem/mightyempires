##Overview

In Mighty Kingdoms each army token represents up to 500 points of a Kings of War army, which are used to explore a hex map to build a player's kingdom. 
When other kingdoms are encountered, the army tokens will also be used to fight Kings of War tabletop battles. Bigger battles are fought by bringing multiple 
army tokens to the same hex. Players will want their kingdoms to be a mix of villages, cities and fortresses to allow them to build and feed armies. Each full game turn 
represents one year, and cycles through summer and winter seasons.

##1. Setup

###Initial kingdom
A) Players each secretly choose a main race (army type) for their Kingdom. Once all players have chosen, they reveal it to all other players simultaneously. This is public knowledge.
B) Players are assigned a random player order. This will change at the end of each month in the Reform phase.
C) In player order each player takes turns choosing a starting tile (denoted with a white circle) by placing a city on it.
D) In player order each player places all of 1 additional city, 1 fortress, and 2 villages on any of the 6 tiles surrounding the capital. They also place control 
markers on the other 2 tiles not occupied by settlements.
E) Each player places 1 army token in 1 tile they control that contains a settlement.
F) Each player writes up a 500 pt army list to represent the starting army. The list must be legal as per the standard Kings of War rules, and may not include any allies. Once written, the list for that army is static and may not change except as per the medal and scar rules, below. Mark the army token with a unique symbol or number, and mark the list with the same symbol or number so you can keep track of it. Digital only lists may be difficult to use to track the status of the units of an army, so printed lists are encouraged. Lists can be kept secret until a battle occurs with that army, at which point all players (not just those involved) may look at all of the lists involved in the battle. Tales of the battle will spread far and wide in the aftermath of the carnage!

##2. The Year

Play proceeds through the summer season and winter season. The summer season is further broken down into months, during each of which players move armies, 
explore tiles and engage in battles. During the winter season players build settlements and new armies.
