#Last stand

##Set-up

After setting up scenery, the defending player chooses one long table edge. The defender sets up all their forces within a box touching the centre of that edge. The size of the box depends on the size of the defending force.

|Defender's Points|Box size|
|:-------|:-------|
|500|12" wide x 12" deep|
|1000|18" wide x 18" deep|
|1500|20" wide x 20" deep|
|2000|24" wide x 24" deep|
|2500|30" wide x 24" deep|
|3000|36" wide x 24" deep|

##Turn sequence

The attacking player starts with all their forces off the board.

The attacker takes the first turn. However, before then, each player may make vanguard moves with their vanguard units, starting with the attacker. The attacker places each of their vanguard units on any of each of the three edges the defender did not choose. They then take their move from there.

When the attacker takes the first turn, at the start of the movement phase they place each of their units on each of any of the three sides the the defender did not choose.

##Duration

The game automatically goes for the full seven turns.

##Objective

At the end of the game, the defending player adds up the total points cost of all of their units remaining on the board; and separately adds up the cost of all attacking units that were Routed.

- If the total points remaining for the Defender is 20% or more of their total (eg 100 points or more if the Defender had 500 points), then the Defender wins.
- If the Defender has been reduced to less than 20%, but the attacker has more than 60% of their force Routed, then the game ends in a Draw.
- Otherwise the Attacker wins.

*Note*: the Defender can be completely wiped out and still have a Draw result. It is assumed the Attackers do not have enough coherent force left to take control of the fortress from the civilians manning it.
